# Introduction to Embedded Software Engineering

## What is Embedded Software Engineering?

Embedded software engineering is the process of developing software for embedded systems. Embedded systems are computers that are designed to perform a specific task. They are often used in applications where a computer would be too expensive, too large, or too power hungry. Examples of embedded systems include:

* Digital cameras
* Video game consoles
* Automobiles
* Medical devices
* Smartphones
* Smart watches
* Smart TVs
* Smart refrigerators
* ...

### What is an Embedded System?

An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors are manufactured as components of embedded systems.


## Embedded Systems Design

### What is the Embedded Systems Design Process?

The design process is similar to the software development process. The design process is iterative and incremental. The design process is also a combination of hardware and software design. The design process is also a combination of system design and software design. The design process is also a combination of system design and hardware design. The design process is also a combination of software design and hardware design. The design process is also a combination of system design, software design, and hardware design.
