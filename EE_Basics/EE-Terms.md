This is a glossary of terms and definitions in electrical engineering.

## Electrical Engineering

Electrical engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism.

## Voltage, Current and Power

Voltage is the difference in electrical potential between two points. It is measured in volts (V). Current is the flow of electrons through a conductor. It is measured in amperes (A). Power is the rate at which energy is transferred. It is measured in watts (W). The equation for power is: P = V * I.

## Ohm's Law

Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Mathematically, this is expressed as: I = V / R, where I is the current in amperes, V is the voltage in volts, and R is the resistance in ohms. The resistance, R, is defined as the ratio of voltage to current.

## Kirchhoff's Laws

Kirchhoff's laws are two rules that describe the behavior of electrical circuits. The first law states that the sum of the voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is zero. The second law states that the sum of the currents entering any node is equal to the sum of the currents leaving that node.

## Capacitors

A capacitor is a device that stores energy in the form of an electric field. It consists of two conductors separated by an insulator. The insulator is called the dielectric. The capacitance of a capacitor is the ratio of the charge on the capacitor to the voltage across the capacitor. It is measured in farads (F). The equation for capacitance is: C = Q / V, where C is the capacitance in farads, Q is the charge in coulombs, and V is the voltage in volts.

## Inductors

An inductor is a device that stores energy in the form of a magnetic field. It consists of a coil of wire around a core. The inductance of an inductor is the ratio of the change in current to the change in voltage. It is measured in henrys (H). The equation for inductance is: L = dI / dV, where L is the inductance in henrys, I is the current in amperes, and V is the voltage in volts.

## Resistors

A resistor is a device that opposes the flow of current. It is made of a material with high resistance. The resistance of a resistor is measured in ohms (Î©). The equation for resistance is: R = V / I, where R is the resistance in ohms, V is the voltage in volts, and I is the current in amperes.

## Diodes

A diode is a device that allows current to flow in one direction and blocks current from flowing in the other direction. It is made of a semiconductor material with a p-n junction. The p-n junction is the boundary between the p-type and n-type semiconductors. The diode conducts current when the voltage across the diode is positive. It blocks current when the voltage across the diode is negative.

## Transistors

A transistor is a device that amplifies or switches electronic signals. It is made of a semiconductor material with a p-n junction. The p-n junction is the boundary between the p-type and n-type semiconductors. The transistor conducts current when the voltage across the transistor is positive. It blocks current when the voltage across the transistor is negative.

## Integrated Circuits

An integrated circuit is a device that contains many transistors and other components on a single chip. It is made of a semiconductor material with a p-n junction. The p-n junction is the boundary between the p-type and n-type semiconductors. The integrated circuit conducts current when the voltage across the integrated circuit is positive. It blocks current when the voltage across the integrated circuit is negative.

## Logic Gates

A logic gate is a device that performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output. The most common logic gates are the AND gate, the OR gate, and the NOT gate.

## Boolean Algebra

Boolean algebra is a branch of algebra that deals with logical operations. The most common logical operations are AND, OR, and NOT. The AND operation is true when both inputs are true. The OR operation is true when either input is true. The NOT operation is true when the input is false.

## Combinational Logic

Combinational logic is a type of logic circuit that performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output. The most common combinational logic circuits are the AND gate, the OR gate, and the NOT gate.

## Sequential Logic

Sequential logic is a type of logic circuit that performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output. The most common sequential logic circuits are the flip-flop and the latch.

## Registers

A register is a type of sequential logic circuit that stores a binary value. The most common registers are the flip-flop and the latch.

## Memory

Memory is a type of sequential logic circuit that stores a binary value. The most common memories are the flip-flop and the latch.

## Microcontrollers

A microcontroller is a type of integrated circuit that contains a processor, memory, and input/output (I/O) ports. It is made of a semiconductor material with a p-n junction. The p-n junction is the boundary between the p-type and n-type semiconductors. The microcontroller conducts current when the voltage across the microcontroller is positive. It blocks current when the voltage across the microcontroller is negative.

## Microprocessors

A microprocessor is a type of integrated circuit that contains a processor, memory, and input/output (I/O) ports. It is made of a semiconductor material with a p-n junction. The p-n junction is the boundary between the p-type and n-type semiconductors. The microprocessor conducts current when the voltage across the microprocessor is positive.
